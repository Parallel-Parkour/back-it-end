## Back-it-End

* The backend of a parking spot rental app, which allows owners of parking spots and driveways to rent out their space for others to park in while attending a big event, going to an appointment in the busy part of town, or any other instance where city parking proves to be a headache.
* Owners can list their space (assigned parking spot, driveway, garage)
